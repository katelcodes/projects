 #Test: Run any automated tests on the Docker image.
 #Push: Push the Docker image to the container registry.
 #Deploy: Deploy the Docker image to the Kubernetes cluster using Kubernetes manifests.

# Step 6: Test the pipeline: The pipeline should automatically build, test, and deploy the new version of the web application to the Kubernetes cluster.
